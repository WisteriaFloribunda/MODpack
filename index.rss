      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Contest </b>| <i>A Life in Oldtown</i><br />
Oldtown is the second largest city in Westeros, a city renowned for its affinity with trade and craftsmanship. Behind the neat facade of rich merchants, nobles and clergy lies the true backbone of the city; dockhands, craftsmen and unspecialised workers, the lowest of the lower classes.<br />
<br />
This contest will focus on the lives of the lower classes in Oldtown. How they live, where they work and what they do for pleasure. The goal is to make a final push to finish the style for the server build and set the groundworks to open up the first district for building. The warp to the contest grounds is /wrap otcontest.<br />
<br />
It’s advised to read the chapters about Plot types, Inspiration, Economy and Architecture of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KSzT0xjpNPmpp4aV-VjTtNStHZR-gq-K/view" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Oldtown document</a>.<br />

Your submission will only count if you have been on our server before under that username. Builders do not need to fill in this form.<br />
<br />
Multiple submissions will be allowed, as well as co-ops. However, you can only receive a prize for one submission. Prizes for co-ops will be divided.<br />
<br />
<b>Judgement</b><br />
Winners will be determined by IwanDeLarch, EStoop and the leaders of the active Oldtown teams, who will each award points for creativity, effort and faithfulness to the theme.<br />
<br />
<b>Prizes</b><br />
Bragging rights and a forum flair: Master Architect of Oldtown<br />
<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hello ArdaCraft and WesterosCraft community members,<br />
<br />
It would be fair to say that our two servers represent the best that large-scale fantasy minecraft building has to offer. Our teams over the years have shared many qualities in common: passion, commitment, talent, and love for our books. These qualities have, in some instances, led to our communities butting heads in sometimes unfriendly ways.<br />
<br />
Each of our communities has had problems in the past with toxic, bigoted, and unwelcoming members. These are chapters of our past neither of us are proud of, especially when these members were allowed to carry on unchecked and unmoderated. We feel that our servers are both today in better places and our communities now have strict guidelines and codes of conduct.<br />
<br />
As a result of improved communication we have noticed that our servers have grown closer together over the past few years, sharing ideas, builders, and the occasional friendly joke at the others expense. However, this increased intermingling of users has in a few instances resulted in some friction and unwelcome behaviour between people from both communities. The purpose of this joint statement is to try and curb this unwelcoming behaviour before it becomes unmanageable and more drastic measures need to be taken.<br />
<br />
While we do not want to forget our mistakes, we want to discourage comments from both sides which weaponize the past to target individuals. We are hoping that with this statement we can encourage everyone to apologize for their past remarks and any hurt caused, intentionally or otherwise, and move forward from there.<br />
<br />
We would also like to thank the vast majority of our members who have been nothing but welcoming and polite; you are what keeps our communities alive.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><div style="text-align: left"><b>Your contacts</b>. We want to get the word out to as many old builders and visitors as we can. If you have any connections with former builders it would be great if you could get the word out to them that we'll want them back. We'll hopefully do a mail out to all forum members with the key details.&#8203;</div></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><div style="text-align: left"><b>Your filmmaking skills/ideas. </b>A big anniversary video is a no-brainer, but what it actually looks like and features is something we could use your help and ideas on. Get in touch if you would like to contribute.&#8203;</div></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><div style="text-align: left">And hey if you wanted to plan a Sunspear server build to launch on the anniversary, THAT would really be swell.&#8203;</div></li>

<b>Theme - GULLTOWN</b><br />
Gulltown is the major port city of the Vale of Arryn. It is located in a fine natural harbor at the northern tip of the Bay of Crabs, southeast of the Eyrie and south of nearby Runestone. It is the largest settlement in the Vale, but is much smaller than King's Landing, Lannisport, and Oldtown.<br />
<br />
Gulltown is due for a redo in the next year or two, so it's about time we start exploring some design influences and consistent themes. Currently, we have a loose idea that the city would represent the pinnacle of the Vale's brand of Swiss inspired architecture, lots of colorful daub patterns, clean streets, crisp mountain air and so on.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the ongoing inspiration thread <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/gulltown-redo-discussion-megathread.2076/" class="link link--internal"><b>Inspiration Thread</b></a><br />
<br />
<b>Contest:</b><br />
Start  6 June 2021 GMT 17:00<br />
End 16 July 2021 GMT 17:00<br />
<br />
Plots available at <b>/warp contest</b><br />
<br />
Multiple submissions will be allowed, as well as co-ops. However, you can only receive a prize for one submission. Prizes for co-ops will be divided.<br />
<br />

Please follow <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/forms/g0hckuaU3yMJpyi22&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1558664733899000" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">this link</a> and leave us your username. Your submission will only count if you have been on our server before under that username. Builders do not need to fill in this form.<br />
<br />
<b>Judgement</b><br />
Winners will be determined by a panel of mods and builders who will each award points for creativity, effort and faithfulness to the theme.<br />
<br />
<b>Prizes</b><br />
Probably <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/westeroscraft/shop?asc=u" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>WesterosCraft Redbubble Store</b></a> gift cards, or at least some coloured nickname flair.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Dear Community, <br />
<br />
we are sad to announce the retirement of three long-time staff members: <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/89/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="89" data-username="WhereRmyDragons">WhereRmyDragons</a> <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/6457/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="6457" data-username="Endymion">Endymion</a> and ZeRamenGuy stepped down from modship. Both Dragons and Endy announced their desire to remain active members of the community, to whichever extent their real life obligations allow them, and we hope to <i>wb!</i> Ramen on the server, soon. We thank each of them for the many years of dedication and enthusiasm for our community. Thanks guys! <br />
<br />
Each ending is also the start of something new, so we are happy to announce that <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/9943/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="9943" data-username="Ric">Ric</a>  and <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/3217/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="3217" data-username="AerioOndos">AerioOndos</a> and <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/8873/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="8873" data-username="DutchGuard">DutchGuard</a> will be promoted to modship in the coming days. We are sure that they will be great assets. Congrats, folks!</div>]]></content:encoded>

As any new account made after December 1st will need to be Microsoft and there for people will be and are having issues getting our launcher to work. For those with Mojang accounts be aware you will have to go through the migration process starting early 2021 to switch to Microsoft or be locked out of your account. Just be aware of them emailing you with information on how to do so. All the information you need about the migration process is below.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><h3><div style="text-align: justify"><br />
Hello everyone&#8203;</div></h3><div style="text-align: justify"><br />
Over the last year we have noticed that a lot of beginning builders have been struggling with creating their first project application. Therefore, we have created a template for applications. Below you will see it is subdivided into multiple categories each corresponding to a different topic. Each category helps you gather the needed information to start your project. These categories include, as per usual, canon, plans and tests. However, a project application is much more than a quick overview of canon, a pretty map and some house tests. It is a tool to properly prepare a project and combine canon and real-live practices, culture etc. Having a better understanding of these aspects will help you better layout your project and adding that extra touch of immersion.<br />
<br />
We expect all apps in the future to follow this template and answer these questions to the best of their abilities. You are free to elaborate and add extra things. Be mindful that mods have to go through all these extra things, so making it clear and concise is much appreciated. Apps that have been submitted but not approved yet are also expected to follow this template from now on. We encourage first time project applicants that have already been approved to also have a look at the categories and think about how they would fill them in for their own projects. It could only come to your advantage.&#8203;</div><h3><div style="text-align: justify"><br />&#8203;</div></h3><h3><div style="text-align: justify"><br />
Project Application Format&#8203;</div></h3>Project applications should be posted in the <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/categories/canon-projects.84/" class="link link--internal"><b>subforum</b> </a>corresponding to the project's region. Thread titles should be formatted as the following<br />
<br />
<b>[Project name] by [Builder name(s)]</b><br />
<br />
In the body of the thread or in an attached Google doc or PDF you must include the following information:<br />
<br />
<b>Project Title<br />
<br />
Builder Name(s)<br />
<br />
<br />
Introduction</b><br />
<br />
The introduction contains general information about the project you are applying for. Things that may be included here are the rough location of a project, a map with the location of the project, general information on the house and other information you want to share.<br />
<br />
<b>Resumé</b><br />
<br />
List of all previously completed projects, immersions, minis and other noteworthy accomplishments. The purpose of this section is to show your previous accomplishments and leadership engagements. This is a quick way for moderators to check if you are up to the challenges the project will present. At minimum, there should be 2 minis here.<br />
<br />
<b>Canon</b><br />
<br />
Description of all relevant canon on the house, history, location, region, nature, population, military activity and most importantly events in the books. It is important here to be throughout but present it in a clear and concise way. All relevant quotes can be attached in this document. Use highlights for important information within the quote.<br />
<br />
Great sources you could use for your research are the books (or on <a href="http://asearchoficeandfire.com/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>A Search of Ice and Fire</b></a>) and secondary sources like <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>A Wiki of Ice and Fire</b></a> and <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Heraldry/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>The Citadel</b></a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Society/ Culture</b><br />
<br />
What can be said about the society and culture in the project? Is there a special form of hierarchy that you can derive from the canon? E.g., clan chieftains in the north. How is the population spread out? Is it clustered around one place or spread throughout? Is there any reason for this? Are there any specific cultural practices that are or could be related to the project? Please try to stay as logical as possible and base yourself on historic methods that would fit with the region.<br />
<br />
Note not every project will have extensive information on this.<br />
<br />
<b>Economy</b><br />
<br />
what makes up the economy of the project? How do they sustain themselves? What does the land offer them? (E.g., hunting and foresting in the woods, agriculture in the open flatter areas, pastures/shepherds on the hills.) How does the internal economy work? Do they trade and with others? How does this impact them? Are there any economic hubs within or near the project?<br />
<br />
<b>Plans</b><br />
Outline your specific plans with as much detail as possible. These plans can include maps, planned Mini Builds, guides, or anything else that might help the moderators understand your vision for the area. It is important that you mark the project borders on your map as well as provide an easily accessible map legend. Please also check the &quot;Borders&quot; layer on the <a href="http://mc.westeroscraft.com/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>DynMap</b></a> to see the extent of your project area.<br />
<br />
<b>Terra</b><br />
<br />
How will you terraform the project? Please provide thorough explanations and inspiration.<br />
<br />
<b>Architecture</b><br />
<br />
What is the style you want to use? How does it relate to nearby projects? Make sure to defer to...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi everyone, <br />
We're now approaching the half way point of the year (alarmingly) quickly, which is usually when about we hold a mid-year building contest.<br />
<br />
The level of engagement/interest in building contests has gone up and down over the years. Before we launch another one we thought it might be a good time to gauge community attitudes  to see if there's any way they could be improved (better prizes/different format) and to get your thoughts and ideas on other community events we could run. <br />
<br />
We've put together a quick anonymous and private survey with some questions about events, contests and prizes. Feel free to answer as many/little as you like. Any ideas would be much appreciated.<br />
 <br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Dear Community,<br />
<br />
due to the steep increase in new builders (welcome to the team!) and an overall lack of available plots, the mods have decided that from now on, build plots shall be rationed.<br />
This is to assure that everyone, but especially our newest members, has equal opportunity to build. From today on, and until further notice, every builder is allowed 2 low class houses OR 1 middle class house OR 1 special plot per week. We will be monitoring the development of this new rule, any infractions will be met with swift justice.<br />
<br />
Enjoy building!<br />
