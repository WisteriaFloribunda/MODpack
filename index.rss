      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Contest </b>| <i>A Life in Oldtown</i><br />
Oldtown is the second largest city in Westeros, a city renowned for its affinity with trade and craftsmanship. Behind the neat facade of rich merchants, nobles and clergy lies the true backbone of the city; dockhands, craftsmen and unspecialised workers, the lowest of the lower classes.<br />
<br />
This contest will focus on the lives of the lower classes in Oldtown. How they live, where they work and what they do for pleasure. The goal is to make a final push to finish the style for the server build and set the groundworks to open up the first district for building. The warp to the contest grounds is /wrap otcontest.<br />
